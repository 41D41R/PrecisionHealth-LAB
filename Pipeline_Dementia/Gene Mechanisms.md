# Frontotemporal Dementia

# GRN loss of function
Haploinsufficiency of GRN causes frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The GRN locus produces progranulin (PGRN), which is cleaved to lysosomal granulin polypeptides (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33500-9)

Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in progranulin (GRN) induce haploinsufficiency of the protein and are associated with up to one-third of all genetic FTD cases worldwide. While the loss of GRN is primarily associated with neurodegeneration, the biological functions of the secreted growth factor-like protein are more diverse, ranging from wound healing, inflammation, vasculogenesis, and metabolic regulation to tumor cell growth and metastasis.  
The majority of GRN mutations are nonsense and frameshift mutations, that introduce premature stop codons and result in nuclear degradation of the mutant mRNA, suggesting GRN haploinsufficiency underlying GRN-linked neurodegeneration(https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.713031/full)


# MAPT
To date (2004), 34 different pathogenic MAPT mutations have been described in a total of 101 tauopathy families.
These include 21 missense mutations, three silent mutations, two in-frame single codon deletions, and eight intronic mutations (Rademakers, R., Cruts, M., & van Broeckhoven, C. (2004). The role of tau (MAPT) in frontotemporal dementia and related tauopathies. Human Mutation, 24(4), 277–295. doi:10.1002/humu.20086)

Exonic mutations are missense, silent or deletion. All but two (R5H and R5L in exon 1) occur in exons 9–13. Most intronic mutations are clustered in the 5′-splice site of the intron following exon 10. These intronic mutations and some exonic mutations located in exon 10 affect the alternative mRNA splicing of exon 10, causing a relative increase of 4R tau (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nan.12213)

Loss of function, including MT binding and assembly, changes in alternative splicing, shifts in protein-aggregation kinetics, and, more recently, prion-like “seeding,” have all been implicated (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41374-019-0197-x)

# MAPT loos of function?
https://doi.org/10.1002/humu.20979:
Whether tau toxicity in FTDP-17 is the consequence of a loss of function mechanism, of an aberrant gain of function resulting from its aggregation  or  of  a  more  complex  mechanism  remains  an  open  question  (for  review  see  (Feinstein  and  Wilson  2005)).  It  has  been  suggested  that  some  mutant  forms  of  the  protein  exert  their  deleterious  effect  via  a  loss  of  binding to MT, which impair the ability of tau to regulate MT dynamics, ultimately leading to cell death (Brandt et al., 2005). However, this loss of function scenario was questioned when it was found that the brain of tau knockout mice,  albeit  showing  inhibition  of  neuronal  maturation  in  primary  hippocampal  neurons  (Dawson  et  al.,  2001),  showed no obvious sign of MT network disruption (Harada et al., 1994). This finding was interpreted as reflecting a functional redundancy between tau and other MAPs. In addition, it should be stressed that, in humans, the FTDP-17   mutation   spectrum   does   not   include   frameshift   or   nonsense   mutations,   and   that   the   rare   cases   of   haploinsufficiency  of  the  MAPT  gene  that  have  been  described  are  associated  with  mental  retardation,  not  with  FTD (Koolen et al., 2006; Shaw-Smith et al., 2006). 

More than 40 different FTD-associated mutations have been found in MAPT.33 Although they are concentrated in certain regions, no single unifying mechanism appears to explain the effect of tau mutations. Most are missense mutations in the microtubule-binding region, some of which are in exon 10 (the alternatively spliced microtubule-binding domain) and thus occur only in 4-repeat tau isoforms, whereas others occur in all 6 isoforms. A few mutations occur outside the microtubule-binding region at the amino or carboxy termini of tau, although because these regions tend to fold back toward the repeat region,69 they may be structurally and functionally related to mutations in the microtubule-binding domains. Finally, some tau mutations are silent (changing the mRNA, but not the protein, sequence) or intronic and shift the ratio of isoforms with 3 versus 4 microtubule-binding domains (3R vs 4R tau). Tau mutations have both loss-of-function (reduced microtubule stabilization) and gain-of-function (increased aggregation and phosphorylation) effects. ( https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.23722)



# Early-Onset Alzheimer Disease

# PSEN1 AND PSEN2
### Loss of function
EOFAD associated PSEN variants compromise γ-secretase function and lead to a biochemical “loss-of-function”, causing dominant negative interference with the wildtype allele or reduced PS expression [26–30]. Consequently, PS dysfunction due to EOFAD PSEN2 variants could compromise CNS immune cell homeostasis similar to the absence of PS2 [15, 16], and thus contribute to AD pathogenesis. (DOI: 10.3233/JAD-200492)

An additional PSEN1 missense mutation was identified in a patient with AAO of 50 years (APOEε3/3), and a PSEN2 start-loss mutation (rs61757781) was present in an individual with AAO of 48 years (APOEε3/3).

Collectively, our experiments revealed that PS1 carrying the fAD-linked proline substitution P264L exhibits notable reduction in γ-secretase activity and increases the ratio of Aβ1–42 to Aβ1–40, while the P267S mutation appears to cause a near-complete loss of PS1 function. (https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/embj.201592042)

https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(15)00099-9.pdf:
Earlier studies in patient plasma, transgenic mice, and cell lines found that PSEN mutations increased Ab42 levels and/or the Ab42/
Ab40 ratio (Borchelt et al., 1996; Duff et al., 1996; Hardy and Selkoe, 2002; Scheuner et al., 1996), leading to the hypothesis that
PSEN mutations cause FAD via a gain-of-function mechanism mediated by selective overproduction of Ab42 (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002). Interestingly, genetic rescue studies in C. elegans showed that PSEN mutations resulted in partial loss of PS activity (Levitan et al., 1996). However, overexpression of the Psen1 A246E transgene rescued the phenotypes of Psen1/ mice
(Davis et al., 1998; Qian et al., 1998), and KI mice carrying the Psen1 M146V mutation did not exhibit phenotypes of Psen1/
mice (Guo et al., 1999), though they exhibited hippocampal memory deficits (Sun et al., 2005). These findings suggested
that PSEN mutations might not impair PS function in the mammalian brain.
Subsequent genetic studies yielded the surprising discovery that loss of PS function in the adult cerebral cortex recapitulates
key features of AD, including progressive memory deficits and age-dependent, widespread neurodegeneration (Beglopoulos et al., 2004; Saura et al., 2004; Wines-Samuelson et al., 2010).
We suggest that the loss of in vivo function conferred by the L435F and C410Y mutations analyzed here represents a general property of FAD mutations. 

### PSEN1 gain of function
Most of the PSEN1 mutations have been reported as gain-of-function mutations, which could increase the gamma secretase cleavage. However, additional reports revealed that some mutations such as P264L, P267S, L435F, and C410Y may interfere with enzyme function, suggesting that they could affect through loss-of-function activities.Citation3 (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.2147/CIA.S111821)

# APP
APP duplication
The interpretation of the 21q21 duplication is straightforward. We had previously established that APP duplication, leading to a 1.5-fold increase in APP expression,18 is a cause of AD with cerebral amyloid angiopathy.19 Consistently, the neuropathological examination of this patient showed Braak stage VI AD lesions with prominent cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Although 15 other genes were involved in this duplication (Figure 1), it is now well-established that the duplication of APP alone is sufficient to cause AD. (https://www.nature.com/articles/mp2015100)

https://elifesciences.org/articles/15645:
γ-secretase dependent accumulation of APP by-products is associated with AD and is considered to be detrimental to neuronal function [review by (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002; Musiek and Holtzman, 2015)]
Accumulation of APP-CTF caused by overexpression of membrane-tethered APP intracellular domain (mAICD) favors axodendritic arborization as a result of direct coupling with GαS and subsequent activation of adenylate cyclase
Loss of APP expression only slightly affects axonal outgrowth, at least in cell culture system.
The recent discovery of an extra copy of the APP gene in familial AD (Rovelet-Lecrux et al, 2006) provides further support that increased Aβ production can cause the disease.

https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/3/884:
APP gene and in people with the APP gain of function mutation that increases Aβ levels, Aβ has been thought to be a major cause of AD [7,8,9]. Supporting this idea, gain-of-function mutations of presenilin 1/2, a gene encoding the components of γ-secretase that processes APP to Aβ, which increased accumulation of Aβ, have been also associated with EOAD

# prediction of missense variants
The possible pathogenic nature of missense variants was predicted using simple online tools, such as PolyPhen-2 (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2), Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT; http://sift.jcvi.org/), and PROVEAN (http://provean.jcvi.org) algorithms. ExPasy analysis was also performed (https://www.expasy.org/) using different parameters, such as Kyte and Doolittle hydrophobicity index, bulkiness, and polarity.
